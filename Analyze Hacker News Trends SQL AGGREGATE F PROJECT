Project:
In this project, you will be working with a table named hacker_news that contains stories from Hacker News (https://news.ycombinator.com) since its launch in 2007. It has the following columns:
  -  title: the title of the story
  -  user: the user who submitted the story
  -  score: the score of the story
  -  timestamp: the time of the story
  -  url: the link of the story
This data was kindly made publicly available under the MIT license (https://opensource.org/license/mit/).

        1. Start by getting a feel for the hacker_news table!
           Let’s find the most popular Hacker News stories:
              SELECT title, score
              FROM hacker_news
              ORDER BY score DESC
              LIMIT 5;
           What are the top five stories with the highest scores?

-  Recent studies have found that online forums tend to be dominated by a small percentage of their users (1-9-90 Rule).
   Is this true of Hacker News?
   Is a small percentage of Hacker News submitters taking the majority of the points?
           
        2. First, find the total score of all the stories.
        
        // 
        SELECT SUM(score)
        FROM hacker_news;
        
        Answer: The total score of the hacker_news table is 6366.

-  Next, we need to pinpoint the users who have accumulated a lot of points across their stories.

        3. Find the individual users who have gotten combined scores of more than 200, and their combined scores.
           GROUP BY and HAVING are needed!
        
        //  
        SELECT user, SUM(score)
        FROM hacker_news
        GROUP BY user
        HAVING SUM(score)>200
        ORDER BY 2 DEXC; {or ORDER BY SUM(score) DESC;  <--  but this line in general is just an optional one)

-  Then, we want to add these users’ scores together and divide by the total to get the percentage.
        
        4. Add their scores together and divide it by the total sum. Like so:
           SELECT (1.0 + 2.0 + 3.0) / 6.0;
           So, is Hacker News dominated by these users?
        
        //
        SELECT (517+309+304+282)/6366.0*100;
        
        Answer: ~22.18 %

-  Oh no! While we are looking at the power users, some users are rickrolling 
   — tricking readers into clicking on a link to a funny video and claiming that it links to information about coding.
   The url of the video is:
   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ

5. How many times has each offending user posted this link?

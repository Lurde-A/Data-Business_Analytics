1. 
Let’s examine the three tables.

SELECT * FROM trips;
SELECT * FROM riders;
SELECT * FROM cars;

What are the column names?
//
Answer: 
      trips table                                      riders table                                cars table

      id - trip ID                                     id - user ID                                id - car ID
      date - trip date                                 first - user first name                     model - car model
      pickup - pickup time stamp                       last - user last name                       OS - operating system
      dropoff - drop-off time stamp                    username - user handle                      status - active or maintenance
      rider_id - user ID                               rating - user average rating                trips_completed - total trips completed
      car_id - car ID                                  total_trips - total rides ridden
      type - type of trip (X, POOL, XL)                referred - referred by (user ID)
      cost - trip cost                                 cars table
      riders table

2.
What’s the primary key of trips?              // trips id
What’s the primary key of riders?             // riders id
What’s the primary key of cars?               // cars id

3.
Try out a simple cross join between riders and cars.
Is the result useful?

//
SELECT riders.first,              OR              SELECT *
   riders.last,                                   FROM riders
   cars.model                                     CROSS JOIN cars;
FROM riders, cars;

4.
Suppose we want to create a Trip Log with the trips and its users.
Find the columns to join between trips and riders and combine the two tables using a LEFT JOIN.
Let trips be the left table.

//
SELECT trips.date,                    OR                      SELECT *
   trips.pickup,                                              FROM trips
   trips.dropoff,                                             LEFT JOIN riders
   trips.type,                                                ON trips.rider_id = riders.id;
   trips.cost,
   riders.first, 
   riders.last,
   riders.username
FROM trips
LEFT JOIN riders 
  ON trips.rider_id = riders.id;            

5.
Suppose we want to create a link between the trips and the cars used during those trips.
Find the columns to join on and combine the trips and cars table using an INNER JOIN.

//
SELECT *                    OR                      SELECT *
FROM trips                                          FROM trips
JOIN cars                                           INNER JOIN cars
  ON trips.car_id = cars.id;                          ON trips.car_id = cars.id;

6.
The new riders data are in! There are three new users this month.
Stack the riders table on top of the new table named riders2.

//
SELECT *
FROM riders
UNION
SELECT *
FROM riders2;

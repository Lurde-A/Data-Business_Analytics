1. Getting started, take a look at the startups table:
SELECT *
FROM startups;
How many columns are there?

// 10 columns - name, location, category, employees, raised, valuation, founded, stage, ceo, info.

2. Calculate the total number of companies in the table.

// 
SELECT COUNT (name)
FROM startups;

Answer: 70 companies.

3. We want to know the total value of all companies in this table.
 
//
SELECT SUM(valuation)
FROM startups;

Answer: 974455790000

4. What is the highest amount raised by a startup?

//
SELECT MAX(raised)
FROM startups;

Answer: 11500000000

5. Edit the query so that it returns the maximum amount of money raised, during ‘Seed’ stage.

//
SELECT MAX(raised)
FROM startups
WHERE stage='Seed';

Answer: 1800000

6. In what year was the oldest company on the list founded?

//
SELECT MIN(founded)
FROM startups;

Answer: 1994

7. Return the average valuation.

//
SELECT AVG(valuation)
FROM startups;

Answer: 15974685081.9672

8. Return the average valuation, in each category.

//
SELECT category, AVG(valuation)
FROM startups
GROUP BY category;

9. Return the average valuation, in each category.
Round the averages to two decimal places.

//
SELECT category, ROUND(AVG(valuation),2)
FROM startups
GROUP BY category;

10. Return the average valuation, in each category.
Round the averages to two decimal places.
Lastly, order the list from highest averages to lowest.

//
SELECT category, ROUND(AVG(valuation),2)            OR            SELECT category, ROUND(AVG(valuation),2)
FROM startups                                                     FROM startups
GROUP BY category                                                 GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY ROUND(AVG(valuation),2) DESC;                            ORDER BY 2 DESC;

11. First, return the name of each category with the total number of companies that belong to it.

//
SELECT category, COUNT(name)            OR                        SELECT category, COUNT(*)
FROM startups                                                     FROM startups
GROUP BY category                                                 GROUP by category;
ORDER BY category ASC;

12. Next, filter the result to only include categories that have more than three companies in them. What are the most competitive markets?

//
SELECT category, COUNT(name)            OR                        SELECT category, COUNT(*)   OR   SELECT category, COUNT(*)
FROM startups                                                     FROM startups                    FROM startups
GROUP BY category                                                 GROUP by category                GROUP by category
HAVING COUNT(name) >3                                             HAVING COUNT(*) >3;              HAVING COUNT(*) > 3
ORDER BY category DESC;                                                                            ORDER BY 2 DESC;

13. What is the average size of a startup in each location?
